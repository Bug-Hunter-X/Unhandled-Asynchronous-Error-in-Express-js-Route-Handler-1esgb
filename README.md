# Unhandled Asynchronous Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js asynchronous programming: unhandled errors in asynchronous callbacks within Express.js route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example where a database error (simulated) within a `setTimeout` callback is not properly handled, potentially leading to a silent failure or unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version, using appropriate error handling techniques.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations, such as database queries or external API calls, can throw errors. If these errors are not handled correctly, they can lead to application instability or unexpected behavior.  In the `bug.js` example, if the `fetchDataFromDatabase` function throws an error, the `res.send()` function in the Express.js route handler might not be executed, resulting in the client receiving no response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to handle such errors properly using `try...catch` blocks to catch exceptions and properly handle errors using middleware in the express app.  This ensures that even if errors occur, the application continues to function gracefully and the client receives informative responses.
